This is a hardware emulator for the hardware that ran the Multics
operating system.

This is pre-alpha.   The emulator does not yet boot Multics.  There is no
support for disk drives yet.  It can read an on-disk version of a real boot
tape and partially processes it.  Console output is implemented but not console input.  At this time the emulator seems to correctly process about 200,000
instructions before hitting a bug.  The following console output is produced
when the appropriate boot tape is used:
	bootload_0: Booting system MR12.5 generated 01/11/93 0832.3 mst Mon.
	bootload_0: Unexpected control word on tape.
	bootload_0: Enter tape drive number for memory dump: 

The only reason for publishing at this time is to allow other people to
critique and collaborate on the code.

This emulator is designed for use with SIMH simulator system.
