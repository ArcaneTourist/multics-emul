This is a hardware emulator for the hardware that ran the Multics
operating system.

This is pre-alpha.   The emulator does not yet boot Multics.  There is no
support for disk drives yet.  It can read an on-disk version of a real boot
tape and partially process it.  Console output is implemented but not console
input.  At this time the emulator seems to correctly process just over two
million instructions before hitting a bug.  The following console output is
produced when the appropriate boot tape is used:
   bootload_0: Booting system MR12.5 generated 01/11/93 0832.3 mst Mon.
   0533>2  scas_init: Size too large on config card for MEM
   0534>7  Multics not in operation; control process: Initializer.SysDaemon.z.

It's unclear if the problem reported is due to errors in the hardware
emulation or in simulated configuration settings.

This is alpha and doesn't finish booting.  The only reason for publishing at
this time is to allow other people to critique and collaborate on the code.

This emulator is designed for use with SIMH simulator system.

See README.source for details of the source code and README.running for
tips on how to actually do test runs.
