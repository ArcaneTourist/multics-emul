These *.list files are the source listings that were generated by the PL/1
compiler and seem to match the objects on the boot tape.

These listings are used by the emulator if loaded with the "xlist" emulator
command.  See the sample "ini" files for examples that load all of
the listings here.

These listings were retrieved from:
http://web.mit.edu/multics-history/source/Multics_Internet_Server/Multics_sources.html

If you wish to add a new listing, a web search for the relevant subroutine
will usually result on a hit within the mit.edu repository.

The corresponding *.pl1 sources may be found in the same places; they
may be within an archive named bound_*.s.archive.  There is also a mapping
at http://www.multicians.org/source-index.html.

The source.ini file provides references to which run-time addresses
represent which alm source files.
